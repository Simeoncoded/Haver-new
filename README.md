# Haver & Boecker Machinery Schedules Integration Project

## Overview

The **Haver & Boecker Machinery Schedules Integration Project** is designed to streamline the process of managing and tracking machinery schedules by integrating data from two separate Excel spreadsheets maintained by the Operations and Project Management departments. The goal is to create a unified, printable schedule for machinery (vibrating screens) that tracks various milestones, including order information, engineering milestones, procurement, assembly, testing, and delivery.

This system enables better tracking, scheduling, and communication across teams, ensuring timely deliveries and improved internal processes.
